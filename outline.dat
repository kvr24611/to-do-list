Here's a basic outline for the To-Do List with File Storage project in Python:

1. Setup and Project Structure:

Create a new Python project folder.
Initialize a virtual environment for your project.
Set up a version control repository if desired.
   
2. Define the JSON Format:
Decide on the structure of your tasks in JSON format, such as {"task": "", "due_date": "", "status": ""}.

3. Create TaskManager Class:
Implement a class (TaskManager) to manage tasks.
Include methods to read tasks from a JSON file, write tasks to a file, and perform basic operations (add, remove, list).

4. Initialize TaskManager:
In the __init__ method of TaskManager, read tasks from the JSON file (if it exists) and initialize the task list.

5. Implement Add Task:
Create a method (add_task) to add a new task to the task list.
Allow the user to input task details, such as the task name, due date, and status.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Implement List Tasks:
Create a method (list_tasks) to display all tasks in the To-Do List.
Print details like task name, due date, and status.

7. Implement File Storage:
Create methods (read_tasks_from_file and write_tasks_to_file) to handle reading tasks from and writing tasks to a JSON file.

8. Create CLI:
Implement a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the To-Do List.
Provide options for adding tasks, listing tasks, and exiting the program.

9. Integrate CLI with TaskManager:
Inside the CLI, create an instance of TaskManager and call its methods based on user input.

10. Run the Program:
Execute your Python script to run the To-Do List program in the CLI.
Interact with the program to add tasks, list tasks, and manage your To-Do List.

11. Test and Refine:
Test your program by adding, removing, and listing tasks.
Refine your code and add features based on your needs.
